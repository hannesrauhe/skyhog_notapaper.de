<h3>About my topic: Co-Processors in DBMS</h3>
<div class="short">
My topic is on how we can use Co-Processors such as graphic cards in a database management system. I'm going to discuss the challenges about this topic and some background.

The CPU is a programmable universal processing unit in our computers. It can process images, filter big amounts of data by certain criteria, calculate scientific formulas on different representations of numbers: integer and therefore fixed point and floating point numbers, analyse texts, and everything else that is done with computers these days. 
Since the CPU's purpose is so generic, it cannot be efficiently optimized for one task.
Looking at the TPC-H benchmark for database systems for example, there are no floating point numbers to process.
<br />
In contrast a co-processor is usually optimized for one purpose or at least a smaller range of tasks.
When I mention co-processors to somebody in his 30s or 40s he usually thinks of the floating point unit that supported the CPUs before the pentium processor in doing floating point calculations.
Nowadays the most popular co-processor is the GPU, which is optimized for image processing.
We can differentiate classes of co-processors by looking at their integration into the computer's CPU. 
<ol>
<li>co-processors such as most graphic cards today are connected via the PCI-Express bus. This means that data has to be transferred to the graphic cards memory, where the GPU can access it. Usually this is the bottleneck [1]. FPGAs also usually work that way.</li>
<li>The second class of co-processors is tightly integrated into the system bus. The GPU part of AMD's APUs fits into that category. It still operates on its own but it shares memory with the CPU [2]. Therefore data can be transferred much faster.</li>
<li>Modern CPUs consist of a collection of co-processors. FPUs are now integrated and have special registers on the CPU. Cryptographic processors also fall in this category. There are instructions in the CPU's set, that use these coprocessors. A software developer usually does not care since the compiler or interpreter of the language he is programming in automatically uses these instructions when possible.</li>
