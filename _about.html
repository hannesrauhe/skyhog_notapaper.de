<h3>What is this about?</h3>

    <p>This blog contains information that I could not publish as a research
        paper because of different reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>it was not enough for a whole paper</li>
        <li>the results were negative and therefore not worth publishing. Still, others
            might be able to learn from my mistakes...</li>
        <li>the results were not significant enough or I'm not able to sell them right</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, as a researcher I feel responsible to let others know what I'm
        doing. Maybe it's just, that I want to be recognized or tell others that
        I have at least a clue of what I am doing although I haven't published
        anything related to that topic.</p>
