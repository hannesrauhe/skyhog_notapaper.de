<h3>What is this about...</h3>
<p>This blog contains information that I could not publish as a research paper because of different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it was not enough for a whole paper</li>
<li>the results were negative and therefore not worth publishing, although others might learn from my mistakes. I'll write a blog post about this "feature" of the research community</li>
<li>the results were not significant enough -- basically my finding did not change anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as a researcher I feel responsible to let others know what I'm doing. Maybe it's just, that I want to be recognized or tell others that I have at least a clue of what I am doing although I haven't published anything related to that topic.</p>
