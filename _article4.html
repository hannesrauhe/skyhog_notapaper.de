<h2>Get the feeling for data-intensive problems</h2>

    <div class="short">Before you consider porting an algorithm to the GPU you should check its characteristics. You may have often heard that it should be calculation/computation-intensive. In this post I try to describe, what that means and be more specific. On the example of a simple re-encoding algorithm I show that this is not the whole truth. Data intensive algorithms can benefit from the high bandwidth of a GPU's RAM, but only if they fulfil certain conditions: they should support streaming and work in a massively parallel fashion.</div>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

*data crunching vs. number crunching - iterations
*streamable - data processed part for part - parts of the result are there early</p>
