<h4>Hardware</h4>

    <p>Our test machine is a Linux workstation equipped with two Xeon E5-2690
        hexa core CPUs and a NVidia Tesla K20 with 8 GB of RAM. The GPUs are connected
        via PCI-Express version 3 with a peak bandwidth of 11.2 GB/s. We measured
        the run-time for the operation with different data structures executed
        with one thread on the CPU, 32 threads on the CPU and on the GPU.</p>

I haven't uploaded it, because it contains mostly code from NVidia's CUDA SDK samples and the Eigen Library. I measured the times using gettimeofday() and the following Eigen-Snippet:
