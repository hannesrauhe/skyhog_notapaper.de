<h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>A lot of colleagues mailed send me the link to PGStrom, because they knew that this is in my domain and some of them also knew that 10x speedups and more in my field of work by using a GPU usually makes me skeptical. Let me summarize what PGStrom does on the GPU: it executes statements in the form of:<br />
<code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE complex formula</code>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

    <p>Our test machine is a Linux workstation equipped with two Xeon E5-2690
        hexa core CPUs and a NVidia Tesla K20 with 8 GB of RAM. The GPUs are connected
        via PCI-Express version 3 with a peak bandwidth of 11.2 GB/s. We measured
        the run-time for the operation with different data structures executed
        with one thread on the CPU, 32 threads on the CPU and on the GPU.</p>

I haven't uploaded it, because it contains mostly code from NVidia's CUDA SDK samples and the Eigen Library. I measured the times using gettimeofday() and the following Eigen-Snippet:
