  <h2>Data Transfer - Hardware solutions</h2>
  <div class="short">
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  The last post described the main problem for data-intensive applications on the GPU: transferring the data to the GPU's memory. 
  Hardware vendors propose different solutions to the problem. 
  I take a deeper look at nowaday's solutions such as UVA and mapped memory and give a small outlook on newer technologies.
